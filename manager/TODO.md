Things I'd like to eventually implement:
* Client-side search functionality
* Client-side enable/disable configured agents
* Server-side authentication support with something like X-Proxy-User and X-Proxy-Role style headers
* Server-side RBAC using above headers, granting/limiting access to Ignore and Delete functionality
